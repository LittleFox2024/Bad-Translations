# Sources
I take ideas from various books, movies and songs in these items.

## Notepad
* Never Gonna Give You Up (Rick Astley) - menu labels
* Sword Art Online - various menu items throughout (includes bloopers of SAO as well)
* Sword Art Online Abridged - paraphrased item in "Never" (file) menu
* Sword Art Online Explained in 5 Minutes - that's the "Up" (help) menu and part of the "Save Document before Closing" dialog...
* Spice and Wolf - one item in the "Gonna" (edit) menu
* Monstress - "Save Document before Closing" dialog. This is also where the name "LittleFox" comes from
