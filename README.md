These use the basic idea of editing an .mui or string table in order to change items such as menus, dialogs, and other written aspects. There will be advanced instructions on a wiki page about how to do this.
If you have your own ideas, feel free to send them to me! You can put it in a pull request. Please include the name and version of the program with the edited file. If it is an .mui or dll, you can choose to upload just the edited file. However, it would be prefered to include the .exe file if possible.
